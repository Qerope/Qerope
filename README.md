## 🧠 About Me

I'm a systems-focused software engineer with a deep interest in **real-time computing, compiler optimization, embedded platforms**, and **DevOps automation**. I've worked across automotive systems, graphics pipelines, infrastructure-as-code, and even designed a RISC-V operating system from scratch.

My work blends **low-level performance engineering** with **cloud-native infrastructure**, and I'm always exploring new ways to bridge hardware efficiency with scalable software design.

## 🔨 My Focus Areas

- **Embedded Systems & RTOS**: Linux, QNX, Zephyr, CAN, camera & sensor stacks  
- **GPU & Compilers**: LLVM, CUDA, Vulkan, shader optimization, performance tuning  
- **DevOps & Infrastructure**: Docker, Kubernetes, Jenkins, GitLab CI/CD, Terraform  
- **Security & Networks**: CEH, CCNA, system hardening, fault tolerance  
- **Cloud & Scaling**: AWS, GCP, automation pipelines, observability
