Hi there! I am a university student at uOttawa, where I am passionate about using technology to solve problems and make the world a better place. I have experience with a variety of programming languages and frameworks, and I enjoy working on projects that challenge me to think creatively and learn new things.

In my free time, I enjoy learning about new technologies and staying up to date with the latest developments in the field of computer science. I also enjoy hiking, playing video games, and spending time with friends and family.

I am excited to be a part of the GitHub community and to share my work with others. I look forward to collaborating with other developers and contributing to a wide range of projects. If you have any questions or would like to work together on a project, feel free to reach out to me on GitHub. I would love to hear from you!
